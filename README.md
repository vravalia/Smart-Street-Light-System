# Smart-Street-Light-System

This system uses sensors that detect motion and light up the street lights to maximum power.

When there is no motion detected, the street lights are dim (Power saving mode).

The system can also be used in Smart Homes to switch on and off the lights using the Cayenne app on the phone that's linked to the code.

The app provides Graphical visualizations showing the amount of movements detected (human/cars) at a specific time.
